### Every time I use the app it resets my home city to a country!


The app will allow you to choose any city for your home city, but it also checks if this city is in the same timezone as your iPhone. If you change your timezone then the app will automatically choose the largest city in that timezone. This means that if you chose a city that is in a different timezone, the next time you use the app it will revert to a city in your system timezone.
