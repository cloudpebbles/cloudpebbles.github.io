This is the support page for [Roman Numerals](/apps/roman-numerals/).


### Why don't my numbers appear as M...?


In Roman Numerals 2.0, the app will automatically show numbers over 3999 in an archaic mode. If you want to view these numbers as M... then you can just tap on the Ⅱ̅ button on the button left.


### Working with large numbers


By default, large numbers will appear with a bar above them (for example v̅), however this can be turned off while converting numbers, or changed in the Settings, where you can find the option to have large numbers appear as IↃↃ or MMMMM, or the default v̅.


### Why does MCIV appear as 1104, but 1104 appears as Ⅰ̅ CIV?


By default, the app will show large numbers (over 3999) with a bar over them. You can turn this off by tapping on the Ⅱ̅ button or changing the large numbers option in the Settings.
